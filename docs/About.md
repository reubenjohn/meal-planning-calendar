**Goal of the Meal Planning System**

This system was designed to simplify weekly cooking while maximizing variety, minimizing waste, and reducing decision fatigue. It's ideal for someone who:

* Only wants to cook **2–3 times a week** (Saturday and Tuesday)
* Prefers meals that are **quick to assemble** on non-cook days (under 5 minutes)
* Wants to eat **high-protein, flavorful meals** using Indian and fusion-style recipes
* Values **ingredient efficiency** (using overlapping ingredients across meals)
* Prefers shopping **once a week** and always having a well-stocked pantry

The result is a **4-week rotating meal plan**, each with:

* Clearly defined cook days and minimal-effort meal days
* Diverse recipes using chicken, paneer, legumes, fish/shrimp, and eggs
* Smart grocery lists, divided into:

  * Always-stocked pantry items
  * Common weekly perishables
  * Specific weekly add-ons

Meals range from hearty curries and stir-fries to wraps, bowls, and backup meals like boiled eggs and salad. The system offers a backbone to build consistency while staying flexible and creative.

### Future Enhancement: Interactive Meal Planning Web App

To make this system even more powerful and user-friendly, the next step could be building a **simple interactive web page** using a coding LLM. Features might include:

* **Clickable meal calendar**: Tap on any day to view its meal, recipe steps, and ingredients
* **Weekly grocery view**: See exactly what to buy each week, grouped by perishables and pantry
* **Recipe and prep library**: Store and search all recipes, including backups and substitutions
* **Cross-referencing**: Automatically show meals that share ingredients to encourage smart planning

This would bring everything—calendar, recipes, ingredients, backups—into one clean, accessible, and dynamic experience to support daily cooking with zero mental overhead.
